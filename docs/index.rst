    Changelog <https://github.com/ucbds-infra/otter-grader/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md>

Otter Grader is a light-weight, modular open-source autograder developed by the Data Science 
Education Program at UC Berkeley. It is designed to grade Python and R assignments for classes at 
any scale by abstracting away the autograding internals in a way that is compatible with any 
instructor's assignment distribution and collection pipeline. Otter supports local grading through 
parallel Docker containers, grading using the autograding platforms of 3rd-party learning management 
systems (LMSs), non-containerized grading on an instructor's machine, and a client package 
that allows students to check and instructors to grade assignments their own machines. Otter is 
designed to grade Python and R executables, Jupyter Notebooks, Myst-Markdown, and RMarkdown documents and is 
compatible with a few different LMSs, including Canvas and Gradescope.

The core abstraction of Otter, as compared to other autograders like nbgrader_ and OkPy_, is this:
you provide the compute, and Otter takes care of the rest. All a instructor needs to do in order to 
autograde is find a place to run Otter (a server, a JupyterHub, their laptop, etc.) and Otter will
take care of generating assignments and tests, creating and managing grading environents, and 
grading submissions. Otter is platform-agnostic, allowing you to put and grade your assignments 
anywhere you want.

Otter is organized into six components based on the different stages of the assignment pipeline, 
each with a command-line interface:

* :ref:`Otter Assign <otter_assign>` is an assignment development and distribution tool that 
  allows instructors to create assignments with prompts, solutions, and tests in a simple notebook 
  format that it then converts into santized versions for distribution to students and autograders.
* :ref:`Otter Generate <workflow_otter_generate>` creates the necessary setup files so that 
  instructors can autograde assignments.
* :ref:`Otter Check <otter_check>` allows students to run publically distributed tests written 
  by instructors against their solutions as they work through assignments to verify their thought 
  processes and implementations.
* :ref:`Otter Export <pdfs>` generates PDFs with optional filtering of Jupyter Notebooks for manually 
  grading portions of assignments.
* :ref:`Otter Run <workflow_executing_submissions_otter_run>` grades students' assignments locally on 
  the instructor's machine without containerization and supports grading on a JupyterHub account.
* :ref:`Otter Grade <workflow_executing_submissions_otter_grade>` grades students' assignments 
  locally on the instructor's machine in parallel Docker containers, returning grade breakdowns as a 
  CSV file.


Installation
------------

Otter is a Python package that is compatible with Python 3.6+. The PDF export internals require 
either LaTeX and Pandoc or wkhtmltopdf to be installed. Docker is also required to grade assignments 
locally with containerization, and Postgres only if you're using Otter Service. Otter's Python 
package can be installed using pip. To install the current stable version, install with

.. code-block:: console

    pip install otter-grader

If you are going to be autograding R, you must also install the R package using 
``devtools::install_github``:

.. code-block:: r

    devtools::install_github("ucbds-infra/ottr@stable")

Installing the Python package will install the ``otter`` binary so that Otter can be called from the 
command line. You can also call Otter as a Python module with ``python3 -m otter``.


Docker
++++++

Otter uses Docker to create containers in which to run the students' submissions. **Docker and our 
Docker image are only required if using Otter Grade.** Please make sure that you 
install Docker and pull our Docker image, which is used to grade the notebooks. To get the Docker 
image, run

.. code-block:: console

    docker pull ucbdsinfra/otter-grader
